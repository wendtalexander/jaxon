## Motivation
jAxon is a combination of the high performance array computing library
[JAX](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/index.html) and my humble attempt to
integrate this in neurobiology. Especially to simulate Integrated-and-Fire
Models. This library is also heavily inspired by current PhD, in which I'm
working an weakly electric fish, meaning there are more specialized models
helping to solve my current needs.

## Installation
You need two major libraries (how saw that one coming?)
[JAX](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/index.html) and for the documentation I'm
using [quarto](https://quarto.org). Please follow the instruction for these
libraries!

Here is a simple workflow of how I install this project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wendtalexander/jaxon
```
