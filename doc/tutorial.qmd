title: "Getting Started with JAX-on"
---

Welcome to our getting started guide! In this tutorial, we'll walk through
the basics of creating a neuron and running a simple simulation.

### 1. Importing the Library

First, let's import `jaxon` and `jax.numpy`.

```{python}
#| echo: fenced
import jax.numpy as jnp
# Assuming your library is structured as src/jaxon/neurons.py
import jaxon.models as models

print("JAX-on imported successfully!")
```

### 2. Creating a Neuron Model

Now, let's instantiate a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron. You can learn
more about all the parameters in our API reference for `[LIF](api.qmd#jaxon.neurons.LIF)`.

```{python}
#| echo: fenced
# Create a LIF neuron with a membrane time constant of 10ms
print("hello")
```

### 3. Running a Simulation

Finally, we can use the `simulate` function to run a simple simulation.

```{python}
#| echo: fenced
# Run for 100 timesteps
print("hello")
```

This tutorial shows the basic workflow for using the library. For more advanced
